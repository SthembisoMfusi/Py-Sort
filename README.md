# üìÅ File Organizer

A simple, beginner-friendly Python tool that automatically organizes files in your directories by moving them into subdirectories based on their file type.

Perfect for cleaning up messy folders like Downloads, Desktop, or any directory that needs organizing!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic File Sorting**: Moves files into organized folders based on file extensions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional packages required!

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. You're ready to go!

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Organize files in your Downloads folder
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads

# Preview what would be organized (dry run)
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --dry-run

# Use a custom configuration file
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --config my_rules.json

# Undo the last organization
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --undo
```

## üìñ Detailed Usage

### Command Line Options

```bash
python py_sort.py [directory] [options]

Arguments:
  directory              Path to the directory to organize or undo organization for

Options:
  --dry-run             Show what would be moved without actually moving files
  --config CONFIG       Path to JSON configuration file (default: config.json)
  --no-stats            Disable detailed statistics at the end
  --undo                Undo the last organization by restoring files to their original locations
  -h, --help           Show help message
```

### Examples

```bash
# Organize your Downloads folder
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads

# Organize Desktop with dry run first
python py_sort.py ~/Desktop --dry-run
python py_sort.py ~/Desktop

# Organize a specific folder with custom rules
python py_sort.py /path/to/messy/folder --config custom_rules.json

# Organize without showing statistics
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --no-stats

# Undo the last organization
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --undo
```

### Example Output

When organizing files, you'll see detailed statistics:

```
Found 15 files to organize...
Moved 'photo.jpg' to 'Images/'
Moved 'document.pdf' to 'Documents/'
Moved 'video.mp4' to 'Videos/'
...

==================================================
ORGANIZATION COMPLETE!
Files moved: 15
Files skipped: 2

==================================================
STATISTICS
==================================================
Total files organized: 15
Total size: 45.32 MB

Files by category:
  Images: 7 files (25.10 MB)
  Documents: 5 files (15.22 MB)
  Code: 3 files (5.00 MB)
==================================================
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) to define how files should be sorted. Here's the default structure:

```json
{
  "Images": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".svg"],
  "Documents": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx", ".txt", ".rtf"],
  "Videos": [".mp4", ".avi", ".mov", ".wmv", ".flv"],
  "Audio": [".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".aac", ".ogg"],
  "Archives": [".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar", ".gz"],
  "Code": [".py", ".js", ".html", ".css", ".java"],
  "Spreadsheets": [".xls", ".xlsx", ".csv", ".ods"],
  "Presentations": [".ppt", ".pptx", ".odp", ".key"],
  "Executables": [".exe", ".msi", ".deb", ".rpm", ".dmg"],
  "Other": []
}
```

### Customizing Rules

1. Copy `config.json` to create your own rules
2. Modify the file extensions for each category
3. Add new categories as needed
4. Use your custom config: `python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --config my_rules.json`

## üîÑ Undo Functionality

The tool logs all file moves to a `py_sort_moves.json` file in the organized directory. This allows you to undo the organization and restore files to their original locations.

### How to Undo

1. Run the undo command in the same directory you organized:

```bash
python py_sort.py ~/Downloads --undo
```

2. Confirm the undo operation when prompted.

3. Files will be moved back to their original locations, and the move log will be cleared.

### Notes

- The undo operation processes moves in reverse order to handle dependencies correctly.
- If a file already exists in the original location, it will be skipped to avoid overwriting.
- The move log is automatically deleted after a successful undo.
- Only the most recent organization can be undone; previous logs are overwritten.

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Or run individual tests:

```bash
python tests/test_file_organizer.py
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Make sure you have write permissions to the target directory
- On Windows, try running as administrator if needed

**"No files found to organize":**
- Check that the directory path is correct
- Make sure there are files (not just folders) in the directory

**"Config file not found":**
- The script will use default rules if `config.json` is missing
- Create a `config.json` file or specify a custom path with `--config`
